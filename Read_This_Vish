Hey Vish I know this is a long shot but I want to shoot it anyway because you're pretty understanding. 
Everything works PERFECTLY when the functions are not under the a Class.
But when I try to import the Lender or Library classes and use the functions from inside those classes, it SOMETIMES gives me errors.
The error is not even consistent, like I can do book.new_books(book_array, name, author) and the code would run great 
But if I try to call a VERY similar and simple code like book.search_book(title), it will say UnboundLocalError: local variable 'book' referenced before assignment or some other different error every.time.
we've tried everythingggg. We did b = Library() so we can call functions by writing b.search_book, but it thinks that it's a constructor call: No value for argument 'book_id' in constructor call , No value for argument 'title' in constructor call , No value for argument 'author' in constructor call
A few of the functions somehow work with just book.function_name and we have no clue why.
The following functions are the ones we cannot call correctly: pay_penalty, search_book, search_author, search_lender
I just followed what you did during class with the ToDo list but I just can't crack it.
We would like to use our 4 HELP tokens to request that you try to figure out how to correctly call the class functions since we didn't really have office hours.
If this is not possible we understand, and thank-you for a great semester. 
We really enjoyed being in your class and you did an amazing job as a professor, we learned a ton!
Bye Vish!
